function y=envelope(signal,Fs)

%y=envelope(Signal,Fs) computes the Envelope of the input Signal with a
%Sampling Frequency 'Fs' and gives the envelope signal by hilbert transform
%method as the output y.
%The function computes the envelope of the signal by two different methods.
%
%First Method: By USing Low Pass Filter. THe Signal is Squared, Passed
%through LPF and then taken square root.
%Second Method: Using Hilbert Transform. Hilbert Transform is taken using
%the inbuilt function in Matlab
%
%The Function Displays the FFT of the original signal and also the FFT of
%the envelope signal by both the methods
%
%The function basically is for computing Envelope Signal for Condition 
%Monitoring of rotating equipments by vibration based bearing 
%fault diagnosis.
%
%Example:
%   load('s4.mat');
%   signal=s4;
%   Fs=12000;
%   envelope(signal,Fs);
%
%The File 's4.mat' is the vibration signal recorded from a OR faulty
%bearing with a sampling frequency of 12000Hz. The Fault frequency is 161Hz
%and is brought out in envelope signal which was hidden in the original
%FFT.
